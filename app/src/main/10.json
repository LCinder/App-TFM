Putin has chosen to fight a war of aggression and destruction in Ukraine. Wherever Russia controls Ukrainian territory, Russians commit genocidal crimes against citizens of Ukraine, including mass rape, mass killing, and mass deportation. A democracy is defending itself against an autocracy, and the fate of democracies hangs in the balance. The Russian hydrocarbon oligarchy is giving us a foretaste of cataclysm that awaits if we do not free ourselves from oil and gas. Russia blockades the Black Sea and halts food exports, threatening to spread death by starvation to tens of millions of people this year. Those are the kinds of things we should be worrying about, not Putin's self-image.Yet there is an even more basic problem with this reasoning, which arises from a false understanding of how power in Russia works.The Russian media and political system is designed to keep Putin in power regardless of what happens in the outside world. Russian politics takes place within a closed information environment which Putin himself designed and which Putin himself runs. He does not need our help in the real world to craft reassuring fictions for Russians. He has been doing this for twenty years without our help.Ukrainians understand this, which is one reason that they become irritated when we suggest that they concede territory or victory to Russia because of a concern about Putin's internal state. They know that this is not only unjust but pointless. What matters in Russian politics is not Putin's feelings nor battlefield realities but the ability of the Putin regime to change the story for Russian media consumers. It is senseless, as the Ukrainians understand, to sentence real people of real territories to suffer and die for the sake of Russian narratives that do not even dependWhat happens if Putin decides that he is losing in Ukraine? He will act to protect himself by declaring victory and changing the subject. He does not need an off ramp in the real world, because that is not where his power rests. All he needs to do is change the story in Russia's virtual world, as he has been doing for decades. This is just a matter of setting the agenda in a meeting. In virtual reality there is always an escape route, and for this reason Putin cannot be 'cornered.' (Neither, for that matter, can the actual Russian army in actual Ukraine. When Russian units are defeated, they just cross back into Russia).Putin's power is coterminous with his ability to change the subject on Russian television. He does this all the time. Think about how the war began. Until late February of this year, the entire Russian media was clamoring that an invasion of Ukraine was unthinkable and that all the evidence was just warmongering by the CIA. Russians believed that, or pretended to. Then, once Russia did in fact invade Ukraine, war was presented as inevitable and righteous. Now Russians believe this, or pretend to. In 2015, when Russia's last invasion of Ukraine failed to meet all of its objectives, the Russian media changed the subject from one day to the next from Ukraine to Syria. This is simply how Russia is ruled: invasions and storytelling about invasions. If the invasion doesn't work out, the story changes.If defeated in reality, Putin will declare victory on television, and Russians will believe him, or pretend that they believe him. He will find a new subject on which to fasten their attention. This is the Kremlin's problem, not ours. These are internal Russian mechanisms in which outside actors are essentially irrelevant. It makes no sense to create an 'off-ramp' in the real world, when all Putin needs is an 'off-ramp' in his virtual world. It will be built by propagandists from pixels, and we are not needed for that. Indeed, there is something more than a little humiliating in Western leaders offering themselves as unpaid and unneeded interns for Russian television channels.The odd thing is that Western leaders know all of this, or should. Given plenty of time to reflect after Russia's last invasion of Ukraine in 2014, we have become aware of the primary role that political fiction plays in Russian life. Everyone who matters in public discussions ought to be aware that Putin governs in media rather than reality. Just three months ago, we all just watched as Putin changed the story from 'war unthinkable' to 'war inevitable.' And yet, for some reason, some Western leaders ignore this basic structural fact of Russian politics when they advocate appeasement.To be sure, Putin might err, in this war or in some other one. He might wait too long to declare victory in the virtual world. In that case he loses power, and someone else takes over the television networks. We cannot save him from such a misjudgment. It will happen sooner or later. It is possible that power in Russia will change hands during this war; we will know that has happened when the Russian media landscape changes. Regardless of whether Putin falls during this war or later, his power over media will be complete until the moment when it ceases. There is no interval where our actions in the real world will be decisive.Now let's think of what we are asking of the Ukrainians when we speak of conceding Ukrainian territory for the sake of giving Putin an 'off-ramp.' We are asking the people who are the victims of a genocidal war to comfort the perpetrator. We are expecting Ukrainians, who know that Russian politics is all about fiction, to make sacrifices in the world where their families and friends live and die. We are asking Ukrainians to sentence their own people to ethnic cleansing in order to make life slightly easier for Russian television producers whose genocidal hate speech is one cause of the atrocities.As Ukrainians keep trying to tell us, clich\u00e9s of 'cornering' and 'off-ramps' will make the war last longer, by distracting from the simple necessity of Russian defeat.When we start the story from Putin's psychic needs and run it through our own misunderstanding of Russian politics, we push Ukrainian democracy to the side. Rather than acting like allied democracies, we behave like amateur therapists for a dictator. We are no good at that. We are directing our empathy towards a dictator who will only exploit it to continue a war, and away from a people who must win that war to end it.Appeasement of Russia distracts us from the people who really are cornered: the Ukrainians. They are facing extermination as a people, and that is why they fight. President Volodymyr Zelens\u2019kyi actually does need a way to end this war, because he does not govern by fiction, because he is an elected leader, and because he feels responsible for his people. Unlike Putin, Zelensky cannot simply change the subject. He has to bring his people along. At this point, Ukrainians by huge majorities believe that the war has to be won, and are unwilling to concede territory. Unlike Putin, Zelens\u2019kyi will have to make a case, referring to what is actually happening on the ground. He therefore really does need help, both to win the war as quickly as possible, and in giving Ukrainians a sense of a post-war future.All reasonable people want this war to end. That means thinking more about the Ukrainian people, and worrying less about problems that Putin does not in fact have.","conversation_id":"1533211581307310081","image":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90069c61-3da7-4b22-a935-55e7c0dac5f8_594x394.jpeg","interactions":4006,"text":"'Some observers of the Russo-Ukrainian war seem to think that its greatest danger is that Ukraine will win, or win too quickly, and that this will be uncomfortable for Putin, and that we should care.

Kallas has been equally tough on the domestic front, where she removed her junior coalition partner Centre Party from government on June 3 after weeks of infighting and proposed forming a new coalition with two smaller parties, with the next election not scheduled until March 2023.Foreign Policy got a chance to speak with Kallas about the threats Estonia faces, the risks of unleashing cyberattacks, and why real peace can only be achieved with Russia\u2019s defeat. This interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity.Foreign Policy: Would you say Estonia is safer than it was six months ago or less safe?Kaja Kallas: I would say it\u2019s safer. For one, we have every big ally who has confirmed or emphasized that we will defend every inch of NATO territory. Plus, no NATO country has ever been attacked. Secondly, we already see a doubling of allies\u2019 troops here. We have discussions in NATO about strengthening the eastern flank, especially the defense of Baltic countries. Third, we have increased our defense expenditure to 2.5 percent [of GDP], and in the coming years it\u2019s going to be even bigger. Moreover, we got much better deals than everybody else for defense procurement, since we knew the Ukraine war was probably taking place thanks to intelligence information.Fourth, the decision by the Swedes and the Finns to join NATO makes the Baltic Sea practically a NATO sea. It also means we are not so dependent on the Suwalki Gap in terms of military aid coming from the south. Lastly, Russia has its hands full with the war in Ukraine, which is not going according to their plans. They are considerably weaker than they were before [the war]. So, yes, we are stronger.At the same time, there are threats, and we will probably see cyberattacks and some show of power. But I think that\u2019s about it. As I said to our Swedish and Finnish friends: If we survived so many years before joining NATO, which was a much longer time than predicted now for Finland and Sweden, so can they.FP: Speaking of cyber: Has NATO returned the favor yet by using offensive cyberweapons against Russia?KK: It\u2019s very hard to answer that question very directly or clearly. I\u2019m in a very difficult position: I hear things in the secret rooms that I can\u2019t talk about. I can\u2019t say we don\u2019t and I can\u2019t say we do. But if we do, we are not talking about this publicly.What I can say is that going on the offensive brings about different risks that you can\u2019t put back into the bottle. So everything we do in cyberspace, also in supporting countries with the right to self-defense, needs to be carefully conducted and accountable. Cyber-operations may constitute an armed attack under the U.N. Charter and give states the right to self-defense. In its response to an armed attack by cyber means, the injured state is not necessarily limited to taking measures by cyber means\u2014all means remain reserved to states in order to respond to an armed attack in a manner that is proportionate and in accordance with other provisions of international law.FP: You\u2019ve said before that \u201cpeace cannot be the ultimate goal.\u201d Do you feel your stance is supported by other European countries?KK: There are different [possible] ends to the war, and I think this is where the differences of opinion lie. For some countries in Europe, peace is the ultimate goal. Their mindset is that with peace, everything is fine. But we had peace after the Second World War, and yet the atrocities for my country started\u2014the mass deportations, the killings. This will happen to the occupied territories [in Ukraine] and the people there, too. This needs to be understood. If the aggressor is not punished and we go back to business as usual, then everything will continue.Nazi crimes were widely condemned after the Second World War, but Communist crimes never were. Actually, [Joseph] Stalin killed more people than [Adolf] Hitler did. If it is not condemned, you see the result: 70 percent of people are in favor of Stalinism in Russia. The history books in Estonia were rewritten after the Soviet Union collapsed, but they were never rewritten in Russia. So if people admire dictators, then there is no obstacle to becoming one or submitting to one.Timothy Snyder wrote a very good thread on Twitter about why saving face for Putin is a totally wrong discussion. Russia has invaded a country\u2014to save face you can just go back to your country and say, \u201cSorry, I made a mistake, and I will pay for everything I did.\u201d Like the prime minister of Ukraine said: \u201cWhen Ukraine stops fighting, there will be no Ukraine. When Russia stops fighting, there will be peace.\u201dFP: So you only see a solution as a military victory\u2014doesn\u2019t this contradict Zelensky\u2019s recent statement that diplomacy is the only way to end war in Ukraine?KK: No, I don\u2019t see a contradiction, because Zelensky also says they are not able to give away territories. What I\u2019ve also said is that it\u2019s wrong when Ukrainians are pressured to enter any kind of peace agreements they are not ready to enter into. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying peace can\u2019t be the ultimate goal if it means that you give away territories, and the atrocities will continue on those territories.FP: There\u2019s been a long-standing fault line between Eastern and Western Europe on Russia, with the former more often sounding the alarm. And there are differences in the EU over Ukraine\u2019s EU membership and an oil embargo on Russia. Will the war in Ukraine bridge those divides, or widen them?KK: I hope there is no divide. It\u2019s true that after we used the window of opportunity [in the early 2000s] to join NATO and the EU, we had people actually asking us, \u201cWhy do you need this? Russia doesn\u2019t pose a threat anymore.\u201d And we replied: \u201cWe know our neighbor, this has happened several times before. So we need all the assurances we can get.\u201dBut I wouldn\u2019t focus so much on the differences, but more of the unity that we have had so far. Of course, we have had difficult discussions before, but in the end we got to an agreement, and that\u2019s the most important part. We also need to listen to different allies\u2019 worries. Plus, multilateralism is hard: In NATO, we have 30 countries; in the European Union, there are 27, all of them democracies. It takes time.But as long as the war is going on, we haven\u2019t done enough. All allies need to invest in and prioritize defense\u2014that means a 2 percent floor, not ceiling.FP: Speaking of not doing enough, Germany has taken a lot of heat. Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks said last month that trust in Germany was now \u201cclose to zero.\u201d What does Germany have to do to deliver on that big foreign-policy shift it proclaimed at the start of the war?KK: Germany has been under huge criticism. But it\u2019s because everybody is expecting Germany to be in the leadership role because of their size and importance in Europe. So I would take that as a compliment. Germany has actually done a lot: They have made huge turnarounds, raising their defense spending to 2 percent and providing heavy weapons to Ukraine. Germany is a democracy, so these big decisions take time. And I won\u2019t join the chorus of those who say that Germany is doing everything wrong, because there are other big allies that could do more as well.FP: That is a very diplomatic answer. You don\u2019t think that Germany could have acted faster? The anti-aircraft tanks it has promised won\u2019t arrive until July. And there\u2019s a lot of criticism even within Germany about not acting swiftly and decisively enough.KK: Yes, but it is very easy to criticize from the outside. Estonia is a small country that can make and implement decisions fast. Bigger countries are like bigger ships, which take longer to turn around. It\u2019s much, much more difficult. What\u2019s important is that Germany is heading in the right direction. One could argue that maybe they took a little bit too much time, but still, what matters is that those decisions have been made.Bottom line, none of us has done enough as long as Russia carries on its war of aggression in Ukraine and the human suffering continues. What Ukraine needs today are weapons to fight back the aggressor and liberate its territories. We need to help Ukraine win.FP: Estonia, along with Lithuania and Latvia, has been pushing NATO to dramatically scale up its military presence in the Baltics to deter Russia from making any military moves on alliance territory as it battles to conquer land in Ukraine. Can we expect any announcement about NATO basing a division in the Baltic states at the NATO summit at the end of June?KK: We are having those discussions right now within NATO and expect the decisions to be made at the next summit in Madrid. We are working on really boosting our defense plan in the Baltic region.In Madrid, we are striving toward a new defense posture\u2014modern forward defense\u2014in our region with the allies. In essence, this means that we need a greater NATO presence in the air, on land, and at sea. In case of any threat, NATO must be ready to defend the Baltic countries right away, which requires a significant number of troops and capabilities. That would include our own units, allied units stationed on our territory, as well as allied forces that can be deployed quickly. We need to make sure that these combat-ready forces exist and have appropriate command and control. NATO\u2019s air policing must become air defense. The military presence of NATO at the Baltic Sea must be increased. And not just more troops, but also high-end capabilities that the Baltic states currently do not have themselves like midrange air defense.FP: You previously raised an intriguing idea of putting payments for Russian gas into an escrow account that could be used for Ukrainian reconstruction. Is there any serious momentum on that, and what are the obstacles?KK: We are still talking about this. Some [countries] are worried that if you pay some to the escrow account, the other side will stop delivering. But this would not mean that the EU stops paying for gas. It would mean that money would be transferred to a special account, where an agreed proportion would be transferred to Russia and the rest kept on the account. Russia could access the rest of the amount when it meets certain conditions, for example pulling back troops.The idea of an escrow account is to reduce the revenues of the Russian regime. We need to do everything we can to stop financing Putin\u2019s war machine. Earlier this week the EU finally agreed on the sixth package of EU sanctions\u2014including a ban on Russian oil imports. This is an important step to further cripple Putin\u2019s war machine. But we cannot stop here. As Russia\u2019s war and crimes against Ukraine rage on, we must continue isolating the Kremlin. This means further sanctions, including on Russian gas.Also, when we talk about reconstruction or rebuilding Ukraine, the first sentence should be that Russia has to pay for everything it destroyed, not that it will come from the European taxpayers\u2019 money. The one who has caused the damage should be held responsible for it.","conversation_id":"1533165345141362688","image":"https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1374879595.jpg?w=1000","interactions":8438,"text":"Spoke to @ForeignPolicy about the pressing need to support Ukraine and why the mindset that \u201cwith peace everything is fine\u201d doesn\u2019t work.

Si hasta ahora hab\u00eda entregado munici\u00f3n, equipos de protecci\u00f3n individual y armas ligeras (lanzagranadas C-90 o ametralladoras), ahora prepara el suministro de armamento pesado, con misiles antia\u00e9reos y carros de combate Leopard, y la imprescindible instrucci\u00f3n de los militares ucranios para que puedan hacerse cargo de su manejo.El Ministerio de Defensa est\u00e1 ultimando ya la entrega a Kiev de una bater\u00eda de misiles antia\u00e9reos de baja cota Shorad Aspide, que el Ej\u00e9rcito espa\u00f1ol ha sustituido por otro sistema m\u00e1s avanzado. El env\u00edo de este material, producido por la compa\u00f1\u00eda europea de misiles MBDA, est\u00e1 pendiente de que concluyan las gestiones a trav\u00e9s de una c\u00e9lula en Stuttgart (Alemania) que se encarga de coordinar las ayudas militares a Ucrania para evitar carencias de unos equipos y duplicidades de otros.El Gobierno espa\u00f1ol tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 dispuesto a entregar a Ucrania los carros de combate Leopard A4 que se encuentran hibernados desde hace una d\u00e9cada en la base log\u00edstica del Ej\u00e9rcito de Tierra en Zaragoza. Estos tanques forman parte del lote de 108 unidades de segunda mano que Alemania vendi\u00f3 a Espa\u00f1a en 1995, como pre\u00e1mbulo del contrato de fabricaci\u00f3n de los Leopard en Espa\u00f1a. La intenci\u00f3n de Defensa era reconvertirlos en carros de recuperaci\u00f3n para ingenieros pero, ante la falta de presupuesto, opt\u00f3 por someterlos a un proceso de deshumectaci\u00f3n (quitarles bater\u00edas, aceites y cualquier otro elemento que pudiera deteriorarlos) y dejarlos almacenados a la espera de disponer en el futuro de fondos. Fuentes de Defensa estiman que unos 40 carros podr\u00edan ser rehabilitados y entregados al Ej\u00e9rcito ucranio, pero advierten de que ello requerir\u00eda someterlos a una puesta a punto por parte de una industria que se muestra poco proclive a acometer estos trabajos en un momento en que le llueven los pedidos por el aumento generalizado del gasto militar en Europa.Adem\u00e1s, Espa\u00f1a ha ofrecido a Ucrania instruir a sus militares en el manejo de esos carros de combate. La instrucci\u00f3n, seg\u00fan las fuentes consultadas, se realizar\u00eda inicialmente en Letonia, donde el Ej\u00e9rcito espa\u00f1ol tiene desplegado un contingente de 500 militares con seis tanques Leopardo 2E, en el marco de la operaci\u00f3n Presencia Avanzada Reforzada (EFP) de la OTAN. En una segunda fase, el adiestramiento de los carristas ucranios se har\u00eda ya en territorio espa\u00f1ol, agregan las mismas fuentes. Este programa permitir\u00eda acelerar los planes de preparaci\u00f3n del Ej\u00e9rcito de Kiev para dotarse de unos potentes carros de combate con los que hacer frente a los modernos T-90 rusos, ya que ahora solo disponen de un centro en Alemania para instruirse en su manejo.El ofrecimiento de los misiles y la instrucci\u00f3n de los carristas se plante\u00f3 cuando el presidente del Gobierno, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, viaj\u00f3 a Kiev el pasado 21 de abril y se entrevist\u00f3 con el presidente Volod\u00edmir Zelenski, pero se ha ido demorando por la complejidad de la operaci\u00f3n, seg\u00fan las fuentes consultadas. Ese mismo d\u00eda zarp\u00f3 de El Ferrol el buque Ysabel del Ej\u00e9rcito de Tierra cargado con 200 toneladas de munici\u00f3n y soportes para misiles. Tambi\u00e9n llevaba 30 camiones y diez veh\u00edculos ligeros que recorrieron 800 kil\u00f3metros por carreteras polacas para llevar el material hasta la base de recepci\u00f3n del Ministerio de Defensa ucranio. Ese cargamento supon\u00eda, en palabras de S\u00e1nchez, \u201cm\u00e1s del doble\u201d del material enviado hasta entonces en 11 vuelos militares de transporte. Con motivo de la visita esta semana a Madrid de Igor Zovkva, asesor de Zelenski, se han relanzado las conversaciones para agilizar la entrega y ampliar la lista de posibles suministros.En una conferencia de prensa el pasado viernes, con motivo de los 100 d\u00edas del inicio de la invasi\u00f3n, el embajador de Ucrania en Madrid, Serhii Pohoreltsev, agradeci\u00f3 la ayuda militar prestada hasta ahora por Espa\u00f1a pero la consider\u00f3 insuficiente, advirtiendo de que la munici\u00f3n solo alcanza \u201cpara dos horas de combate\u201d. \u201cEstamos agradecidos pero no podemos decir que estemos satisfechos\u201d, subray\u00f3.El representante diplom\u00e1tico de Kiev pidi\u00f3 armas pesadas (misiles antibuque y antia\u00e9reos, obuses de 155 mil\u00edmetros o morteros de 120), pero sobre todo reclam\u00f3 la entrega de tanques Leopard, incluso antes de instruir a los militares ucranios que deben emplearlos. \u201cHay buena voluntad del Gobierno espa\u00f1ol y del Ministerio de Defensa sobre el env\u00edo de instructores para ense\u00f1ar el funcionamiento de esos carros de combate, pero lo importante son los tanques\u201d, subray\u00f3. El embajador insisti\u00f3 en que su pa\u00eds no pide \u201cnada que Espa\u00f1a no pueda aportar\u201d y se quej\u00f3 de que, seg\u00fan sus informes, Espa\u00f1a presenta \u201cuno de los menores \u00edndices de ayuda militar [a Ucrania] en relaci\u00f3n con su presupuesto de Defensa\u201d.El diplom\u00e1tico encuadr\u00f3 su petici\u00f3n en la nueva fase de guerra prolongada y de desgaste en que ha entrado el conflicto, con la ocupaci\u00f3n del 20% de su territorio por las tropas rusas y la destrucci\u00f3n del 30% de su infraestructura. Y asegur\u00f3 que el Gobierno espa\u00f1ol ha mostrado un \u201capoyo indiscutible\u201d a la causa de Kiev y no ha percibido en su seno \u201csimpat\u00edas prorrusas\u201d, pese a las cr\u00edticas de los ministros de Unidas Podemos a la entrega de material militar a Ucrania.A lo que no puso ning\u00fan reparo el diplom\u00e1tico es a la acogida en Espa\u00f1a de los 140.000 ucranios (mujeres, ni\u00f1os y ancianos) que han llegado huyendo de la guerra, de los que que 116.000 ya han obtenido el estatuto de protecci\u00f3n internacional. \u201cEl proceso ha estado bien organizado\u201d, reconoci\u00f3.","conversation_id":"1533339760449982464","image":"https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/FAXG-qNnIp-JR6BJ1fuao8CzLdU=/1200x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/UUBXJ567FND2NLPTRIX3RCATSM.jpg","interactions":784,"text":"According to El Pais Spain is willing to deliver both Aspide SAM and older Leopard 2A4 in storage to #Ukraine.

","title":"","truthfulness":"0.003"},{"body":"As many as 500,000 people have died from war and famine in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia over the past 16 months, researchers say.The estimate, by experts who have closely monitored the Tigray conflict since its beginning, is a rare attempt to calculate the war-related death toll in a region that has been largely cut off from the outside world.The estimate includes 50,000 to 100,000 victims of direct killings, 150,000 to 200,000 starvation deaths, and more than 100,000 additional deaths caused by a lack of health care, according to researchers led by Jan Nyssen of Ghent University in Belgium.The war began when Ethiopia sent its military into Tigray in an attempt to subdue the rebellious regional government in November, 2020. The neighbouring country of Eritrea also sent troops into Tigray, and the war has led to massacres of civilians, destruction of hospitals and clinics, an exodus of refugees and the emergence of famine. Ethiopia has blocked most food aid to the region for months.Despite the huge death toll, there are growing fears that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine will overshadow the Tigray war and other long-running conflicts in Africa and the Middle East, reducing global attention and humanitarian aid for those crises.Many of the most horrific crises, from Mozambique to Yemen, are in remote regions or countries where access is difficult. The war in Ukraine could further damage the flow of assistance by diverting humanitarian funds and increasing the cost of food and fuel. Some relief agencies are already reporting a decline in funding for their Africa operations as donors switch to Ukraine.\u201cWe are seeing clear evidence of this war draining resources and attention from other trouble spots in desperate need,\u201d United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told journalists on Monday.In Ethiopia, authorities have blocked communications and flights into Tigray since the war began, while heavily restricting media access. \u201cThe Ethiopian government has been very efficient in shielding Tigray from outside eyes,\u201d Prof. Nyssen said in an interview.The death toll in Tigray is poorly documented because humanitarian workers were banned from bringing cameras into the region and continue to be threatened with expulsion if they speak out, he said.Prof. Nyssen and his team have maintained a database of confirmed deaths in Tigray since the war began, in which they recorded 289 incidents causing the deaths of up to 12,478 civilians. But the true number of deaths from violence is far higher, they believe.Starvation is an even bigger threat. The vast majority of Tigray is considered \u201chard to reach\u201d or \u201chighly restricted\u201d in the latest UN humanitarian report. Malnutrition is increasing, and humanitarian agencies say their supplies of food and fuel are almost exhausted. Most have been forced to suspend or drastically reduce their operations.Because of the lack of food aid, lack of income and dysfunctional markets, the majority of Tigray\u2019s families have resorted to begging, cutting meals or selling their harvest to pay off their debts, the UN report said.Unlike the Ukraine war, however, the Tigray conflict has not led to any international sanctions or votes of condemnation in the UN General Assembly, analysts have noted.In the Sahel region of West Africa, struggling with armed violence and food shortages, there are growing worries about a diversion of aid to Ukraine. M\u00e9decins du Monde, a humanitarian agency working in Burkina Faso, warned last week that some of its donors are planning to cut their funding by 70 per cent and shift the money to new Ukraine operations.\u201cWe are very concerned that this will become a trend, making access to health care and other basic services even scarcer for displaced people,\u201d said a statement by Safia Torche, general director for M\u00e9decins du Monde in Burkina Faso, where more than 1.7 million people have left their homes because of violence and hunger.The Food and Agriculture Organization, a UN agency, predicted on Friday that the war in Ukraine could cause an increase of 8 per cent to 22 per cent in international food and feed prices, which would push as many as 13 million more people into hunger over the next year.Ukraine and Russia are major exporters of wheat, barley, corn and other food products, but the war is causing a supply gap and forcing prices up.\u201cThe likely disruptions to agricultural activities of these two major exporters of staple commodities could seriously escalate food insecurity globally,\u201d FAO director-general Qu Dongyu said in a statement.\u201cWheat is a staple food for over 35 per cent of the world\u2019s population, and the current conflict could result in a sudden and steep reduction in wheat exports from both Russia and Ukraine,\u201d he said.Mr. Guterres described the war in Ukraine as an \u201cassault\u201d on the world\u2019s most vulnerable people and countries. \u201cWe must do everything possible to avert a hurricane of hunger and a meltdown of the global food system,\u201d he said.Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day\u2019s most important headlines.
